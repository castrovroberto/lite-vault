**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** April 27, 2025

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the software requirements for the Minimal Secure Secrets Manager (MSSM). MSSM is designed to provide a secure, centralized system for managing dynamic database credentials, JWT key rotation, and secure storage of static secrets like password peppers. It aims to reduce risks associated with hardcoded or statically managed sensitive information.

### 1.2 Scope
- **Included:**
    - Dynamic database credential generation and rotation.
    - JWT cryptographic key management and rotation.
    - Secure storage and retrieval of static secrets.
    - Core security mechanisms: authentication, authorization, encryption, sealing, auditing.
    - RESTful API interface.
- **Excluded:**
    - UI interfaces.
    - Support for every database type (initially PostgreSQL and MySQL only).
    - Advanced authentication methods.
    - HSM integration.
    - Complex alerting/monitoring integrations.

### 1.3 Definitions
- **Secret, Dynamic Secret, Lease, Rotation, JWT, Pepper, Authentication, Authorization, Secrets Engine, etc.** (Definitions as detailed in the original document.)

### 1.4 References
- RFC 7519 (JWT)
- TLS 1.2 Specification
- OWASP Top 10 Security Risks

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
MSSM operates as a standalone secrets broker, interacting with external databases and applications.

### 2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Administrators:** Configure and manage MSSM securely.
- **Applications/Services:** Authenticate and consume secrets via API.

### 2.3 Operating Environment
- Linux servers.
- Persistent encrypted storage.
- TLS-secured network.

### 2.4 Design Constraints
- Security-first design.
- Low-latency API.
- Horizontal scalability.
- Data durability and high availability.

### 2.5 Assumptions
- Secure backend storage.
- TLS-enabled networks.
- External systems can use APIs properly.

### 2.6 Dependencies
- File system or cloud-based storage backend.
- PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

#### 3.1.1 Core Vault Functionality
- Secure storage of secrets (F-CORE-100).
- Token-based authentication (F-CORE-110).
- ACL-based authorization (F-CORE-120).
- Immutable audit logging (F-CORE-130).
- Seal/unseal mechanism (F-CORE-140).
- TLS-secured REST API (F-CORE-150).

#### 3.1.2 Database Dynamic Password Rotation
- Secure configuration for target databases (F-DB-200).
- Database roles with TTL (F-DB-210).
- On-demand credential generation (F-DB-220).
- Lease management and automatic revocation (F-DB-230).
- PostgreSQL support initially (F-DB-241).

#### 3.1.3 JWT Key Rotation
- Named cryptographic key management (F-JWT-300).
- Key versioning (F-JWT-310).
- Signing and verification APIs (F-JWT-320/330).
- Admin-triggered key rotation (F-JWT-340).

#### 3.1.4 Static Secrets Storage (Password Peppers)
- Encrypted static secret storage (F-STATIC-400).
- Secret update and retrieval APIs (F-STATIC-410/420).

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- AES-256 encryption at rest (NFR-SEC-100).
- TLS 1.2+ encryption in transit (NFR-SEC-110).
- API input validation (NFR-SEC-120).
- Least privilege principle enforced (NFR-SEC-130).
- API performance benchmarks (NFR-PERF-200/210).
- Data durability guarantees (NFR-REL-300).
- Horizontal scalability design (NFR-SCAL-400).
- Modular, extensible architecture (NFR-MTN-500).

## 4. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for v1)
- UI Dashboard.
- More authentication methods (OIDC, LDAP).
- Hardware Security Modules (HSM) integration.
- Disaster recovery and replication support.

## Additional Recommendations
- **Metrics and Observability:** Integrate Prometheus for metrics scraping.
- **Secure Bootstrapping:** Create a "bootstrap mode" for first admin user generation.
- **Performance Testing:** Include performance load testing early using k6 or similar tools.
- **Zero Trust:** Apply Zero Trust principles for internal service communication.
